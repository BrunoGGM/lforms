          <h1>LForms Demos</h1>
          <p>A widget for rendering feature-rich forms defined in JSON definition files</p>
          <hr>
        </div>

<p>The following demos introduce LForms a few features at a time using simple
forms.  For a set of demos showing of the full feature set of LForms, including skip
logic and score rules, see the <a
href="https://lforms-demo.nlm.nih.gov">lforms-demo</a> website, or see the last
demo, which lets you pull in LOINC forms.</p>

<ol>
  <li class="demo">
    A form with just a single question.  The form definition (which you can see
on the "JavaScript" tab of the demo) only defines the question
    "Eye color".  By default, the form template includes some top level questions
seen here (Date Done, etc.)  Also, the form template includes some checkboxes.
If you click on "Display Question Code" you will see the code for both the form
and the question.  Both of these these parts are configurable and removable.
    <div>
      <a class="showSource" _src="lforms/rxmdh3jq">[Show Demo]</a>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="demo">
    This is the same form but configured to turn off both the checkboxes and the
top-level questions.  (In the form definition, obrHeader is what controls the
visibility of the top-level questions.)
    <div>
      <a class="showSource" _src="lforms/kga7h72f">[Show Demo]</a>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="demo">
    If you do want the top-level questions, but want different ones, that can be
controlled as well.  Here is an example with different fields.
    <div>
      <a class="showSource" _src="lforms/0nLt814m">[Show Demo]</a>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="demo">
    Questions can can coded answer lists.  The dataType for list questions
should be set to either "CNE" ("coded with no exceptions", which limits input to list choices) or "CWE"
("coded with exceptions", which allows entry of off-list answers).
    <div>
      <a class="showSource" _src="lforms/v0uo9kam">[Show Demo]</a>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="demo">
    Questions can also be date fields with a calendar input, or be numeric
fields with units.
    <div>
      <a class="showSource" _src="lforms/90so0gxg">[Show Demo]</a>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="demo">
    When answer lists are too large to be included directly in the form
definition, they can be specified via a URL which returns matches as the user
types.  Several such data sources are available on <a
href="https://lforms-service.nlm.nih.gov">lforms-service</a>.  (If you wish to
construct your own, the web service receiving the URL will need to understand
certain parameters and return data in the expected format.  For information on how to do that,
see the documentation for the autocomplete-lhc <a
href="http://lhncbc.github.io/autocomplete-lhc/docs.html#searchList">search
list</a>, a look at the requirements for the "url" parameter to the
constructor.)
    <div>
      <a class="showSource" _src="lforms/83of00cj">[Show Demo]</a>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li>TBD -- More demos to come, showing multi-answer questions, sections,
repeating sections, questions in tables, skip logic, and more!</li>

  <li class="demo">
    The RxTerms demo form.  This simple form just has two fields, one which
    provides a search autocompleter and one which obtains its list of strengths from
    the data associated with the selected drug name.
    <div>
      <a class="showSource" _src="lforms/ccbr6nos">[Show Demo]</a>
    </div>
  </li>

  <li class="demo">
    LOINC forms.  The autocompleting field at the top lets you select a
    form which is then rendered below.
    <div>
      <a class="showSource" _src="lforms/weaqqbg4">[Show Demo]</a>
    </div>
  </li>
